                <h2>BIO</h2>
                <p>Blake Tollison Shelton (born June 18, 1976) is an American 
                country music singer and television personality. In 2001, he made 
                his debut with the single "Austin". The lead-off single from his 
                self-titled debut album, "Austin" spent five weeks at number one on 
                the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. The now Platinum-certified 
                debut album also produced two more top 20 entries ("All Over Me" 
                and "Ol' Red").
                <br>
                His second and third albums, 2003's The Dreamer and 2004's Blake 
                Shelton's Barn & Grill, are gold and platinum, respectively.[1] His 
                fourth album, Pure BS (2007), was re-issued in 2008 with a cover of 
                Michael Bublé's pop hit "Home" as one of the bonus tracks. His 
                fifth album, Startin' Fires was released in November 2008. It was 
                followed by the extended plays Hillbilly Bone and All About Tonight 
                in 2010, and the albums Red River Blue in 2011, Based on a True 
                Story... in 2013, Bringing Back the Sunshine in 2014, and If I'm 
                Honest in 2016.
                <br>
                As of November 2019, Shelton has charted 40 singles, including 
                26 number ones, 17 of which were consecutive. The 11th No. 1 
                ("Doin' What She Likes") broke "the record for the most consecutive 
                No. 1 singles in the Country Airplay chart's 24-year history". He 
                is an eight-time Grammy Award nominee.
                <br>
                Shelton is also known for his role as a judge on the televised 
                singing competitions Nashville Star, Clash of the Choirs, and as
